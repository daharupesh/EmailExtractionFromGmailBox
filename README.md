# Gmail Extraction to CSV Project

## Overview

This project is designed to extract Gmail IDs from emails and save them in a CSV format. The script connects to a Gmail account using the IMAP protocol, retrieves email information, and extracts the email IDs to create a CSV file. This project is useful for anyone looking to collect and organize email addresses from their Gmail account efficiently.

## Features

- **Email Extraction**: Extracts email addresses from your Gmail inbox.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the extracted email IDs into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
- **Filtering**: Includes options to filter emails based on specific criteria (e.g., domain names).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- IMAPClient
- Email libraries (`email`, `imaplib`)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas imapclient
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gmail-extraction-csv.git
   cd gmail-extraction-csv
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:

   Make sure you have Python installed. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Gmail Settings**:

   Before running the script, ensure your Gmail account allows access to less secure apps and IMAP access is enabled.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:

   After setting up, run the script to start extracting emails:

   ```bash
   python extract_emails.py
   ```

2. **CSV Output**:

   The script will generate a CSV file named `extracted_emails.csv` in the root directory, containing the extracted email addresses.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of the output:

| Name          | Email ID               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| suhag.unjiya  | suhag.unjiya@rku.ac.in  |
| amanjays17    | amanjays17@gmail.com    |
